# Angular Projects

Welcome to my Angular Projects repository! This space is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering Angular, a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Currently, I am focusing on Angular version 17 and working on implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations.

## About The Project

This project serves as a hands-on playground where I explore various Angular concepts, particularly CRUD operations in Angular 17. By developing small projects and examples, I aim to understand the intricacies of Angular and how it can be used to build efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.
